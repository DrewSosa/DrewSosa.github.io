Here’s what I’m working on at the moment. **[3 Project Tiles]**

- **Creating an unjammable, unspoofable GPS-alternative** using quantum sensing and AI as a ML Engineer at SandboxAQ.
- **************************************************Building [Marble Labs](https://www.notion.so/Innovative-Companies-and-Organizations-2485412a084e4a8ba11eacfc045f88cd)** with ******************[Kelvin Yu](https://twitter.com/kelvinotcelsius)****************** to empower technologists and policymakers to work together and build public goods that solve national and global challenges.
- **Exploring how AI is enacting the second generation of scientific computing** in a series of essays with [Tanisha Bassan](https://twitter.com/tanishabassan).
- **Playing jazz and angsty rock tunes in Brooklyn.** I owe many thanks to my dear friend [Mathias](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mathias-van-regemortel-763328a2/?originalSubdomain=be) who introduced me to guitar and jazz music.

### **Past work**

- I worked as a national security consultant advising policymakers across National Security Council, State Department, the Department of Defense (and its military branches) and Congress on defense innovation policy.
- I was the first employee at the [Day One Project](https://www.notion.so/Design-7ef4842c249848aa8c0db275f74a4899), a science and tech policy incubator, where I helped develop ambitious and actionable policy ideas on issues such as reforming the $700B+ defense budget, electrifying the aviation ecosystem, and training diverse scientists.
- With [Sam Greydanus](https://greydanus.github.io/about.html), I developed [Dissipative Hamiltonian Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.10085.pdf), which allow scientists to understand their complex data on a deeper level than before. Our paper was accepted as an [ICLR 2022 Workshop paper](https://blog.iclr.cc/2021/12/17/announcing-the-accepted-workshops-at-iclr-2022/). I was fortunate to have the support of the ML Collective, an independent, nonprofit organization with a mission to make research opportunities accessible and free by supporting open collaboration in machine learning research.
- I published my research on the rise of autonomous weapons and militarized AI in the [Peace Review Journal of Social Justice](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10402659.2021.1998856?tab=permissions&scroll=top).  Happy to send a copy if you are interested in reading it!
- In a past life, I steeped in the natural sciences. I researched ultra-bright neutron stars as an Astrophysics Fellow in Caltech’s [NASA NuStar Group](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/nustar/main/index.html), supervised by [Dr. Fiona A Harrison](https://pma.caltech.edu/people/fiona-a-harrison). Before that I was a undergraduate research assistant on the [NASA BARREL Mission](https://www.nasa.gov/mission-pages/rbsp/barrel/) supervised by [Robyn A. Millan](https://faculty-directory.dartmouth.edu/robyn-m-millan).

# All Media I’ve Consumed

I wanted a place to record all of my cultural education—so I made one! This list includes everything I can remember, but is bound to be non-exhaustive.  I update this about every month or so.
